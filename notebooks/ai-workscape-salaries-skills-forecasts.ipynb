Key Insights from Prophet Forecast Analysis:\n\n**Slight Downward Trend in AI Job Postings**\n\n* The red trend line indicates a subtle decline in the number of AI job postings moving forward.\n\n* This doesn't suggest a collapse, but rather a market cooling after a peak.\n\n**It could reflect:**\n\n    * Budget tightening\n\n    * Post-hiring surge correction\n\n    * Shift from hiring to AI tool adoption by non-tech industries\n\n**Short-Term Volatility but Long-Term Stability**\n\n* **The wide blue band (confidence interval) suggests:**\n\n      * While the median forecast shows mild decline, actual postings could still fluctuate significantly month to month (from ~870 to ~1000).\n\n      * Indicates uncertainty in market behavior — possibly due to economic, regulatory, or tech disruption factors.\n\n**Cyclicality Not Strongly Evident**\n\n* The absence of sharp up/down movement implies low seasonality.\n\n* Job postings may not follow clear seasonal hiring cycles — instead, trends are more trend-driven (e.g., funding cycles, product launches, global events).\n\n**Forecasted Job Range (Next 6 Months)**\n\n* Lower Bound: ~860–870 job postings/month\n\n* Upper Bound: ~1000–1010 job postings/month\n\n* Central Estimate: around 930–940\n\n* This range is wide enough to be cautious, but centered closely enough to show stability in hiring.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# SALARY PREDICTION USING RANDOMFORESTREGRESSOR","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Select features and target\nfeatures = [\n
