Missing Data Insights\n- **Highly Sparse Features**  \n  - *Incomplete Rides* & *Incomplete Rides Reason*: ~94% missing  \n  - *Cancelled Rides by Customer* & *Reason for Cancelling by Customer*: ~93% missing  \n  - *Cancelled Rides by Driver* & *Driver Cancellation Reason*: ~82% missing  \n  ‚û°Ô∏è These are **event-driven** columns, filled only when cancellations/incompletion occur.  \n  - NaN here does **not mean lost data**, but rather ‚Äúnot applicable‚Äù (i.e., the ride was completed successfully).  \n\n- **Moderately Sparse Features**  \n  - *Booking Value*, *Ride Distance*, *Payment Method*, *Avg CTAT*: ~32% missing  \n  - *Driver Ratings*, *Customer Ratings*: ~38% missing  \n  ‚û°Ô∏è These are critical features and missingness seems tied to ride outcomes (e.g., no value when a ride was incomplete).  \n\n- **Well-Populated Features**  \n  - *Date, Time, Booking Status, Vehicle Type, Pickup & Drop Locations*: 0% missing  \n  ‚û°Ô∏è Reliable for temporal and categorical analysis.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Patterns in Missingness\n- `missingno` plots confirm that missing values cluster together:\n  - Cancellations and their reasons are missing **together** for completed rides.  \n  - Booking value, ride distance, and payment method are missing **together**, indicating that financials are only recorded when a ride is completed.  \n  - Ratings are missing whenever rides are incomplete or cancelled.  \n‚û°Ô∏è Missingness is **structural (not random)**, which makes handling more straightforward.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Numerical Feature Summary\n- **Avg VTAT (Vehicle Wait Time)**:  \n  Mean ~8.5 min, range 2‚Äì20. Reasonable for ride-hailing pickup times.  \n\n- **Avg CTAT (Customer Trip Time)**:  \n  Mean ~29 min, range 10‚Äì45. Reflects typical trip durations.  \n\n- **Cancellations & Incompletion**:  \n  Always recorded as `1` when the event occurs, missing otherwise ‚Üí can be safely converted into **binary flags (0 = No, 1 = Yes)**.  \n\n- **Booking Value**:  \n  Mean ~‚Çπ508, with large variance (‚Çπ20 ‚Äì ‚Çπ4277). Strong right skew ‚Üí may require log transformation.  \n\n- **Ride Distance**:  \n  Mean ~24.6 km, capped at 50 km ‚Üí suggests long rides are common, with system-imposed limits.  \n\n- **Driver & Customer Ratings**:  \n  Centered at 4.2‚Äì4.4 (out of 5), with low variance. Indicates overall high satisfaction, but subtle differences across segments may be meaningful.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Data Cleaning Implications\n- **Cancellations & Incompletion**: Replace NaN with `0` (no event).  \n- **Booking Value, Distance, Payment, Ratings**: Check relationship with booking status before imputing/dropping.  \n- **Outlier Handling**: Booking value likely has extreme highs; consider winsorization or log scaling.  \n- **Date/Time Transformation**: Must combine into `datetime` and extract useful features for demand analysis.  \n\n---\n\n‚úÖ **Conclusion**:  \nThe dataset is mostly clean with well-structured event-driven missingness.

Booking Status Distribution\n- ‚úÖ **Completed rides dominate** the dataset, accounting for the majority of trips.  \n- ‚ùå Among cancellations:  \n  - **Driver cancellations** are the largest contributor, followed by **‚ÄúNo Driver Found‚Äù** and **Customer cancellations**.  \n  - A smaller share of rides are marked as **Incomplete**.  \n‚û°Ô∏è Suggests a potential supply-demand mismatch at times (drivers cancel or not available).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Vehicle Type Popularity\n- **Auto** is the most frequently used ride type, showing strong urban reliance.  \n- **Go Mini** and **Go Sedan** follow closely, indicating balanced demand for small and medium cars.  \n- **Bikes** have notable popularity (likely for short trips, low cost, and traffic convenience).  \n- **Premier Sedan** serves a smaller premium niche, while **eBike** and **Uber XL** remain relatively rare.  \n‚û°Ô∏è The platform caters to both **mass-market (Auto, Mini, Sedan, Bike)** and **premium users (Premier Sedan, XL)**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Payment Method Usage\n- **UPI** is the most common non-missing payment method, reflecting India‚Äôs digital payment adoption.  \n- **Cash** is still widely used, suggesting hybrid adoption.  \n- **Credit/Debit Cards** and **Wallets** are smaller contributors.  \n- A large portion of Payment Method values are **NaN**, likely due to incomplete/cancelled rides where no payment was processed.  \n‚û°Ô∏è Strong shift towards **UPI-led cashless economy**, but cash still relevant.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Booking Value Distribution\n- Distribution is **right-skewed**:  \n  - Most rides cost under ‚Çπ1000.  \n  - A small fraction of outliers extend beyond ‚Çπ2000‚Äì‚Çπ4000.  \n- Suggests the need for **log transformation** or outlier handling before modeling.  \n‚û°Ô∏è Pricing appears consistent with NCR intercity ride market, but extreme values may distort averages.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Ride Distance Distribution\n- Distances are capped at **50 km**, with a relatively uniform spread beyond ~15 km.  \n- Most rides fall between **5 km and 20 km**, which fits intra-city commutes.  \n‚û°Ô∏è Indicates NCR rides serve both **short daily trips** and **longer commutes**, with a mix of demand.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Ratings Distribution\n- **Driver Ratings**: Centered around **4.2‚Äì4.4**, but with a tail of lower ratings (<3.5).  \n- **Customer Ratings**: Heavily skewed to **5 stars**, showing customers rate drivers generously.  \n‚û°Ô∏è Ratings inflation exists, but occasional low driver ratings may signal service quality issues.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Temporal Trends\n- **Hourly Trends**:  \n  - Low rides between midnight‚Äì5 AM.  \n  - Sharp rise from **6 AM**, peaking at **10 AM (morning commute)**.  \n  - A second peak at **5‚Äì7 PM (evening commute)**.  \n  - Decline after 9 PM.  \n- **Weekday Trends**:  \n  - Rides are fairly **evenly spread across all weekdays**, including weekends.  \n  - Slightly higher activity on **Mondays and Fridays**, possibly due to office commuting.  \n‚û°Ô∏è NCR mobility follows a **bi-modal commute pattern** typical of metro cities.\n\n---\n\n### üìå Key Takeaways\n1. **Completion rate is strong**, but driver cancellations are a bottleneck.  \n2. **Autos and budget cars dominate**, while premium categories remain niche.  \n3. **UPI has overtaken cash**, but hybrid modes still exist.  \n4. **Ride distances and values are skewed**, requiring transformations for modeling.  \n5. **Customer satisfaction is high**, though driver ratings show more variance.  \n6. **Morning and evening commute peaks** drive the majority of ride demand.  \n\n---\n\n‚úÖ This univariate analysis sets the stage for deeper exploration of **relationships (bivariate analysis)** ‚Äî e.g., cancellations by vehicle type, booking value vs distance, ratings vs payment method, etc.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# üîó Step 6: Bivariate Analysis\n\nIn this step, we explore **relationships between two variables** at a time.  \nThis helps us understand how different features interact with each other and influence ride outcomes, pricing, and customer satisfaction.\n\nWe‚Äôll cover:\n\n1. **Numerical Relationships**\n   - Booking Value vs Ride Distance  \n   - Booking Value vs Avg CTAT  \n   - Correlation Heatmap for numerical features  \n\n2. **Categorical vs Categorical**\n   - Booking Status vs Payment Method  \n   - Booking Status vs Vehicle Type  \n   - Cancellation Reasons (Customer vs Driver)  \n\n3. **Categorical vs Numerical**\n   - Booking Value by Vehicle Type  \n   - Ride Distance by Vehicle Type  \n   - Ratings vs Vehicle Type  \n   - Ratings vs Payment Method  \n\nThis analysis reveals behavioral, operational, and financial insights.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# --- 1a.

Numerical Relationships\n- **Booking Value vs Ride Distance**  \n  - As expected, higher distances generally lead to higher fares, though the scatter is wide.  \n  - Many rides cluster below **‚Çπ2000 for <20 km**, while outliers exist at high fares (>‚Çπ3000).  \n  - The spread indicates additional factors (vehicle type, surge pricing, traffic) affect price beyond distance.\n\n- **Booking Value vs Avg CTAT (Trip Time)**  \n  - Positive association, but again noisy.  \n  - Longer trip times (>30 min) tend to cost more, yet some short trips also show high fares (likely premium rides or congestion).\n\n- **Correlation Heatmap**  \n  - Weak linear correlations overall:  \n    - `Ride Distance` and `Avg CTAT` show moderate positive correlation (0.10).  \n    - Booking Value surprisingly has very weak correlation with both distance and trip time ‚Äî suggesting pricing depends on **vehicle type, surge, or location demand**.  \n    - Ratings show almost **no correlation** with operational metrics, highlighting that satisfaction is independent of fare/distance.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Categorical vs Categorical\n- **Booking Status vs Payment Method**  \n  - Completed rides dominate UPI and Cash payments.  \n  - Cancellations or incomplete rides mostly fall under `NaN` payment method (since no transaction occurred).  \n  - Among processed payments, UPI is the leader.\n\n- **Booking Status vs Vehicle Type**  \n  - `Auto`, `Go Mini`, and `Go Sedan` dominate completed rides.  \n  - Driver cancellations are more frequent in budget categories (Auto, Mini), possibly due to low fare or mismatch issues.  \n  - Premium types (Premier Sedan, XL) have fewer rides but a slightly higher completion ratio.\n\n- **Cancellation Reasons**  \n  - **Customer side**: \"Change of plans\" and \"Wrong address\" stand out as top reasons (excluding Not Applicable).  \n  - **Driver side**: \"Customer related issue\" and \"Personal & car related issues\" dominate.  \n  - Interesting: \"Customer was coughing/sick\" and \"More than permitted people\" hint at **COVID-era behavioral shifts and safety concerns**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Categorical vs Numerical\n- **Booking Value by Vehicle Type**  \n  - Premium vehicles (Uber XL, Premier Sedan) have higher median booking values.  \n  - Autos and Bikes have the lowest fares, with tight distributions.  \n  - All categories show extreme outliers (>‚Çπ3000).  \n\n- **Ride Distance by Vehicle Type**  \n  - Distances are fairly similar across categories (~25 km median).  \n  - Suggests **vehicle choice is more about comfort/cost** than trip length.\n\n- **Ratings by Vehicle Type**  \n  - Customer ratings skew higher (closer to 5), especially for `Go Sedan` and `Premier Sedan`.  \n  - Driver ratings are slightly lower, with more spread in `Auto` and `Bike` segments.  \n  - This points to **service quality differences across ride types**.\n\n- **Ratings by Payment Method**  \n  - Ratings remain stable across payment modes (~4.2‚Äì4.5).  \n  - Slightly higher customer ratings for **UPI and Card** transactions, possibly reflecting smoother experience vs cash.\n\n---\n\n### üìå Key Takeaways\n1. **Distance and time only weakly explain fares** ‚Üí pricing model likely includes **vehicle type, surge, and geography**.  \n2. **Driver cancellations are a key operational issue**, especially in budget rides.  \n3. **UPI dominates completed rides**, aligning with India‚Äôs fintech adoption trend.  \n4. **Premium rides deliver higher satisfaction**, while budget rides show wider variance in ratings.  \n5. **Cancellation reasons highlight operational inefficiencies** (wrong address, plan changes) and **driver constraints** (customer issues, car-related problems).  \n\n---\n\n‚úÖ This bivariate analysis gives strong insights into **behavioral and operational drivers** of ride outcomes.  \nNext, we should look at **Step 7: Temporal Trends** to explore how demand, cancellations, and revenue vary by **time of day, day of week, and month**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# ‚è∞ Step 7: Temporal Trends\n\nIn this step, we analyze **time-based ride patterns** to understand demand cycles and operational bottlenecks.\n\nWe will explore:\n\n1. **Hourly Trends**  \n   - Number of rides per hour  \n   - Cancellations and incomplete rides by hour  \n\n2. **Weekday Trends**  \n   - Ride demand by weekday  \n   - Cancellations vs completions across weekdays  \n\n3. **Monthly Trends**  \n   - Seasonal trends in rides, cancellations, and revenue  \n\n4. **Revenue Over Time**  \n   - Total booking value trends by month and weekday  \n\nThese insights reveal how **time of day and seasonality** influence demand and cancellations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# --- 1a.
